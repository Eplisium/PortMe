# Advanced Port Scanner Requirements
# Compatible with Python 3.7+

# Core dependencies (most are built-in to Python)
# Most functionality uses only Python standard library:
# - socket (network operations)
# - threading (multi-threading)
# - concurrent.futures (thread pool execution)
# - tkinter (GUI - included with Python on Windows)
# - argparse (CLI parsing)
# - ipaddress (IP address validation)
# - logging (logging functionality)
# - json (data export)
# - dataclasses (data structures)
# - typing (type hints)
# - platform (system detection)

# Required for configuration file support
PyYAML>=5.4.1           # YAML configuration file parsing

# Optional but recommended: For additional export formats
openpyxl>=3.1.2         # Excel (.xlsx) export support

# Optional: For enhanced functionality (uncomment if needed)
# requests>=2.25.1        # For HTTP banner grabbing enhancements
# python-nmap>=0.6.1      # For nmap integration (advanced users)
# colorama>=0.4.4         # For colored terminal output on Windows

# Phase 1 Enhancement Dependencies
numpy<2.0,>=1.21.0        # NumPy compatibility for matplotlib
matplotlib>=3.7.0         # Network visualization graphs
networkx>=3.1             # Network topology and graph algorithms
requests>=2.31.0          # CVE API lookups and HTTP requests
